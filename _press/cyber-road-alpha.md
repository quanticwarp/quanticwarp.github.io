## Description
"Cyber Road Alpha" is an addictive and challenging game based on users' responsiveness and competitiveness. Dodge the traffic and escape from the police at high speed. Earn coins by accelerating to the maximum and buy cars with iconic designs. Increase your score using powers you find along the way, such as “Shield” or “Invisibility,” and reach the highest global scoring positions.
The user has at his disposal different types of cars that can be acquired with coins that are obtained according to the duration of each game. Each player will be motivated to restart games each time his life bar runs out and will get a score that will place him on the podium of global lists of players in the game.
The game is based on:
- Reaction speed: The user has a limited view of the scenario ahead. The user keeps full attention on the elements of the scenario to avoid colliding or acquiring powers that extend his playing time.
- Futuristic design: The user identifies scenarios with futuristic motif with the use of neon colors, drones, levitating cars and electronic music adjusted to the game.

## Features
- Automatic acceleration and turbo and braking buttons to dodge traffic at different speeds.
- Different models of cars that can be purchased with a coin system integrated into the game (Alpha Coins) and are inspired by famous cars of popular culture.
- Collection of supporting powers to improve score. The Shield power makes the user's car immune to shocks. Invisibility power allows you to drive through traffic cars to extend game time.
- Police drones chase the player and try to capture him. They drop bombs and can detonate the player.
- Quick games with different levels. Each level gives a different amount of coins. The greater the difficulty, the higher the score and the coins obtained.
- Three difficulty levels: Normal, Difficult and Brutal.
- The speed of reaction is very important to avoid traffic. That's why the game has 3 different types of controls. One of them is based on the inclination of the player's device.
- Each game ends when the user's power bar runs out. It happens if the user collides with traffic, buildings or is captured by the police. The player starts with a full life bar that can be filled with objects that he picks up on the way.
- Futuristic appearance with neon colors on stage and user auto.
